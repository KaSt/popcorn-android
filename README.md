### Attention
This is the project to build the android package with Cordova + NodeJS as service.

### How to use:

You need the Android SDK -- [View details here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

 1. `npm install`
 2. `grunt`
 3. Import the project in eclipse -- attention you need to use the `eclipse-project` subfolder of this project as root folder of the new project.

 ### Error or update ?

 Try with `grunt update` it'll rebuild with all deps and will reimport all needed files.
